# Welcome to MkDocs Caption

Enhance your [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) documentation with easy figure,
table captioning and numbering. But it does not stop there. You can also add
captioning and numbering to literally any element you want. And the best part
you do not even need to add additional CSS or JavaScript to your site, just
enable the plugin and you are good to go.

## Credits

This is an open source project. It lives from your contributions, be it in form
of bug reports, feature requests, discussions, or fixes and other code changes.
I am happy to see other people contributing ideas or even building on top of it.
If you encounter any issues or have ideas for improvements, feel free to open an
issue or a pull request.

Of course, I am not the only one who has thought about adding captions to
MkDocs. There are numerous other projects or workaround that try to solve the
same problem. What makes this project unique is that it is able to handle 
captions for images, tables and even custom elements. Also, it is a native 
MkDocs plugin, which enable it to detect the caption elements more reliably
and to integrate well with other plugins.

If you are looking for an alternative, you might want to check out the
following projects:

* [markdown_caption](https://github.com/evidlo/markdown_captions) native Markdown
  extension for adding captions to images.
* [mkdocs-img2fig-plugin](https://github.com/stuebersystems/mkdocs-img2fig-plugin)
  MkDocs plugin for adding captions to images.

If you know other plugins or projects that should be listed here, feel free to
open an issue or a pull request.
