# Referencing Figures And Tables

Referencing elements in markdown is pretty straight forward. Since this plugin
adds a default id to all figures and tables created these ids can be used to 
reference the element. The following example shows how to reference a figure.

=== "Markdown"

    ```Markdown
    ![Caption text](assets/demo.png)

    See [Figure](#_figure-1) above for more details.
    ```

=== "HTML"

    ```html
    <figure id=_figure-1>
        <img src="assets/demo.png" alt="This uses the alt as caption" />
        <figcaption>Figure 1. Caption</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>See the <a href="#_figure-1">Figure</a> above for more details.</p>
    ```

!!! warning
    Although a default id is added to each figure/table it is not recommended 
    use it as a reference. The reason is that the order of the figures/tables
    might change. This will result in the wrong figure/table being referenced.
    Instead it is recommended to assign a custom id to the figure/table.

## Automatic Link Text Generation

Often one would like the link text to look something like `Figure 1` or `Table 1`.
Sure this can be done manually, but it is tedious and error prone. This plugin
can automatically generate the link text for you. This done by referencing the
figure/table id and not specifying a link text.

=== "Markdown"

    ```Markdown
    ![Caption text](assets/demo.png)

    See [](#_figure-1) above for more details.
    ```

=== "HTML"

    ```html
    <figure id=_figure-1>
        <img src="assets/demo.png" alt="This uses the alt as caption" />
        <figcaption>Figure 1. Caption</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>See <a href="#_figure-1">Figure 1</a> above for more details.</p>
    ```

!!! note
    The link text can be customized by using the `reference_text` option in the
    configuration. See the [config chapter](#config.md) for more details.

## Cross Page referencing

The automatic link text generation also works across pages. The mechanism is the 
same as for local references. If no link text is specified the plugin tries to 
replace it with the autogenerated link text.

=== "Markdown"

    **`page_a.md`**

    ```Markdown
    ![Caption text](assets/demo.png)
    ```

    **`page_b.md`**

    ```Markdown
    See [](page_a.md#_figure-1) for more details.
    ```

=== "HTML"

    **`page_a.html`**

    ```html
    <figure id=_figure-1>
        <img src="assets/demo.png" alt="This uses the alt as caption" />
        <figcaption>Figure 1. Caption</figcaption>
    </figure>
    ```

    **`page_b.html`**

    ```html
    <p>See <a href="page_a.html#_figure-1">A/Figure 1</a> for more details.</p>
    ```

!!! note

    The config parameter `cross_reference_text` can be used to customize the 
    link text for cross references. The default is `{page_title}/{local_ref}`
